## Overview

This project is an ongoing development of a full-stack event management platform designed to simplify the creation, management, and attendance of events. The system will allow organizers to host free and paid events, manage ticket sales, and verify identities, while providing attendees with seamless RSVPing, ticket purchasing, and transfer capabilities. Currently, the project is focused on building a backend, with frontend development and payment integration planned for future phases.

## Features (Planned and In Progress)

- **Event Creation and Management**: Organizers can create events with details like titles, ticket types, capacity, and cover images. Private events will support invite-only access (implemented).
- **File Storage and Image Optimization**: Event images and KYC documents are stored securely using Cloudflare R2, with Cloudflare Images for optimized image previews (implemented).
- **Paid Events and Payments**: Planned integration with local gateways for ticket purchases (to be implemented).
- **Ticket Management**: Attendees will be able to RSVP, purchase, and transfer tickets via email, enhancing flexibility (partially implemented).
- **KYC Verification**: Organizers will undergo identity verification through document uploads, with admin approval workflows for compliance (implemented).
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for event invitations, ticket transfers, and KYC updates, with email support (partially implemented).
- **User Roles**: Supports organizer, attendee, and admin roles with role-based access control (partially implemented).

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript, Express.js, MongoDB for API and data management (actively developed).
- **Frontend**: React planned for a dynamic user interface (to be implemented).
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for scalable file storage, Cloudflare Images for image optimization (implemented).
- **Payments**: local gateways planned for transaction processing (to be implemented).
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions (implemented).

## Purpose

This project showcases my ability to design and develop a scalable web application using modern technologies. Currently focused on backend development, it demonstrates skills in API design, cloud storage integration, and secure user management. The project will evolve to include frontend and payment features.

## Future Enhancements

- Complete frontend development with React for a responsive user interface.
- Integrate local gateway for paid event ticketing.
- Add support for recurring events and advanced organizer analytics.
